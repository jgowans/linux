title: Ftrace per-CPU ring buffer contents

maintainers:
  - Alexander Graf <graf@amazon.com>

description: |
  An ftrace trace array contains a ring buffers for each CPU. This
  object describes the buffers of such a single CPU. It describes which
  CPU it was used in and which memory was backing the ring buffer.

properties:
  compatible:
    enum:
      - ftrace,cpu-v1

  cpu:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      CPU number of the CPU that this ring buffer belonged to when it was
      serialized.

  mem:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32-array
    description: |
      Array of { u64 phys_addr, u64 len } elements that describe a list of ring
      buffer pages. Each page consists of two elements. The first element
      describes the location of the struct buffer_page that contains metadata
      for a given ring buffer page, such as the ring's head indicator. The
      second element points to the ring buffer data page which contains the raw
      trace data.
